# Image-processing-for-object-detection
To improvise the counting system we are performing erosion and dilation on detected objects. 
Dilation and erosion are two fundamental morphological operations. Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image, while erosion removes pixels on object boundaries. 
The number of pixels added or removed from the objects in an image depends on the size and shape of the element used to process the image. It is typically applied to binary image, 
but there are versions that work on grey scale image. 
This system also provides a method to set the level of erosion and dilations. After converting the captured gesture into a grey scale image, erosion and dilation are performed. 
The pixels which are random forms into a bulk of single object. The number of objects are counted and thereby the gesture is identified. 
Based on the number of fingers shown in the gesture an action is performed. For example, if gesture 1 is identified then accordingly ‘paint’ program is opened.


Above mentioned document illustrates the object detection , steps to install all the softwares and how to run the sample code given.
